      <h2>What to know</h2>
        <p>Situated in the Arkansas River Valley just 45 minutes from Arkansas Wine Country, this state 
        park sits atop the 1,350-foot Mount Nebo. The 1930s-era Civilian Conservation Corps constructed 
        many of the rustic-style cabins, pavilions, bridges, and 32.6 miles of hiking and mountain biking 
        trails. Cabin 1 was the first cabin rental in state park history. Twelve of the parkâ€™s 15 cabins 
        are located along the bluff and have views of the river valley below. Most of the campsites do 
        as well. There are 34 campsites (24 Class B and 10 hike-in tent sites). Note: there is not a dump 
        station at the park. Other facilities include a swimming pool (fee required), tennis courts, picnic 
        areas, pavilions, and a visitor center with a gift shop.</p>
        <p>Mount Nebo State Park is a certified Trail of Tears National Historic Trail Site. Mount Nebo, 
        overlooking the Arkansas River from the south, witnessed the removal of all five of the tribes 
        that were removed along the water route of the Trail of Tears. Mount Nebo offers panoramic views 
        of the Arkansas River from the Rim Trail. Learn more about the Trail of Tears in Arkansas state 
        parks.</p>
